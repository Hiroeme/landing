I'm sorry I didn't have the words. I never do.

A light dimmed, and my world became a little bit darker.

A mirror shattered, and even if I piece back the shards together, it will never be the same.

It's supposed to be a new year—an occasion of new beginnings and happy memories. Yet, I find myself so sad.

I get flooded with all the memories we shared. I'm watching them like a movie, feeling as though you're right next to me. But you have already left the theater.

Our cakes. Our studying sessions. Our dates. Our talks. Your voice. Your laughter. Your presence.
I can't stop my tears.

I have all the gifts and cards you ever gave to me in front of me. I reread the cards as if your love is still there.

I'm not sure why I do this when it makes me so sad. It's so illogical. But I guess I want to pretend you're still close to me.

So many happy memories, and it hurts even more that I won't be able to make more memories with you again the same way.

I'm sorry I didn't do enough. I feel like I was so caught up in my own problems that I neglected you.

I keep thinking about what I could do to fix this, but I think you have already made up your mind. And there's nothing I can do anymore.

They say time heals all wounds—that it gets better, I will eventually forget, the indifference sets in, and I will move on.

I know this is true, but that scares me so much, because I will lose the part of me that loved you.

I hope that we can continue to be casual friends with none of the awkwardness.

I truly wish you the best in everything you will do in your life. Actually, I know you will be the best! Everything will go your way I bet!

Thank you for the wonderful, amazing experience.
