I left my shoes out to dry overnight, and someone stole them.

The shoes that served me well in college and beyond.

Who steals old, worn-out shoes?

I genuinely hope it was a mother who didn't have money to buy shoes for her child.

I doubt it, but I hope so.

I've been losing so much; I feel like God is testing me.

Wish I had someone to hold me, and to tell me everything is going to be okay.
