Hey!~

I recently went to the movie theater and watched Fujimoto's *Look Back*.
Even though I came in with low expectations (or so I say, because I had read the one-shot beforehand, and knew it was going to be good, but I didnâ€™t want to get my hopes too high), I still left the theater in complete awe and with a heavy heart.
The characters' relatability and the exploration of their emotions, paired with the human touches in the animation, really hit home for me. I found bits and pieces of myself while watching.

- comparison with others
- keep going pushing on besides that
- even though you think you aren't doing enough, someone else, even your "rival", thinks you're the most amazing person.
- push to become your own person
- you never know when death is going to come
- cherish the people around you
- regret, but you know what? you actually saved the person.
